# Thread-Detection-using-openCV
This project detects and counts the number of threads in an image using **OpenCV** and **Python**. The script processes the image, applies adaptive thresholding, detects contours, and draws bounding boxes around detected threads while displaying the total count.
## âš¡ Features
- **Automatic thread detection** using contour analysis
- **Adaptive Thresholding** for better accuracy
- **Noise Removal** using Morphological Operations
- **Bounding Box Visualization** for detected threads
- **Thread Count Display** on the image

## ðŸ“‚ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before running the script:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
